        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>American Lasagna is a classic baked dish known for its rich layers and bold, comforting flavors.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (or Italian sausage)</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (24-ounce) jar tomato sauce or marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (or a mix of dried basil, oregano, thyme)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg (optional, to mix with ricotta)</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to cut acidity)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li> 
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain and lay flat on a baking sheet or drizzle lightly with oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onion and sauté until translucent (about 3-4 minutes).</li> 
            <li>Add minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.</li> 
            <li>Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon. Drain excess fat if needed.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, sugar (if using), salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Let the sauce simmer on low for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with the egg (if using) and a pinch of salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Layer 4 noodles over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella over the ricotta.</li>
            <li>Add about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the cheese layer.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers two more times (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce).</li>
            <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles topped with remaining meat sauce and sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil (to prevent cheese from burning).</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake an additional 20-25 minutes until bubbly and golden on top.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna sit for about 10-15 minutes before cutting. This helps it set and makes serving easier.</li>
